Upload a JSON file generated by Google's Lighthouse website auditing tool and this plugin will compress and replace all flagged images using the reSmush.it API.

== Instructions ==

1. Run [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) on the page of your website you want to optimize images. The easiest way to do this is [using Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/#devtools), but you may also utilize the [Lighthouse Chrome Extension](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/#extension) or [run an audit on the command line using Node](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/#cli).
2. [Download the report as a JSON file.](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/#json)
3. In the Wordpress Dashboard, navigate to `Media -> Lighthouse Image Optimizer`, upload the JSON file and click "Optimize Images."
